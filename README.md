# Hello #


In this repository I'm currently doing some self-study Machine learning stuff. My goal is to get acquinted with a bit more fancy arechitecures, mainly for computer vision and representation learning. (Mainly to prepare myself for a project that I will likely be doing later this year)

Currently I'm working on refreshing my Pytorch Skills (coding architectures from scratch)

1. Autoencoders MLP and convolutional. 
2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
3. Transformers, Vision Transormers and prerequisite knowledge/experience of/with related architectures for working with these
